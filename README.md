1. Door Locking System with Keypad:
The project utilizes a keypad to input a password for unlocking/locking the door.
The keypad allows numeric and special character input for the password.

2.  Automatic Door Locking Feature:
The system includes a timer-based automatic door locking feature.

3.  User Interface and Visual Feedback:
The project employs an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) to provide a user interface for entering the password and displaying messages.
LED indicators (Green and Red) are used to provide visual feedback on the door's status (locked/unlocked).
When a password is entered, the LCD displays "Access Given" if the password is correct or "Incorrect Password" if it is incorrect.
The LCD also displays messages such as "Door Locked" and "Door Unlocked" to indicate the current state of the door.
